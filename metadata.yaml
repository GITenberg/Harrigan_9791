description: In Harrigan, prolific writer Max Brand takes a detour from the dusty
  trails of the West where his novels were typically set and spins a gripping nautical
  tale set in Hawaii and upon the open sea. What starts out as a chance meeting between
  two men turns into a heated race for priceless treasure -- and the love of a remarkable
  woman.
